Rats have become an emblematic reality of New York City. In recent years
following the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns over increased rat sightings
in NYC have drawn national attention. Previous mayoral administrations
have tried to tackle the “War on Rats” with little success. The rat
mitigation efforts are a priority for NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who has
announced various mitigation efforts since taking office in 2022. One of
these efforts is the changing of trash pick-up times. As of April 1,
2023, trash can only be put out on sidewalks after 8pm, a change from
the previous rule that allowed trash to be set out after 4pm.

The growing number of rat sightings are a public health issue. Rats are
vectors for many diseases and they can contaminate human food with
pathogens as they gnaw on packaging to access food, drop feces, and
leave behind other bodily fluids. Our motivation for this project is to
explore rat sighting data in different parts of NYC and assess whether
mitigation efforts have had any significant impact on the rat
population. We hypothesize that the rat mitigation efforts will lead to
decreased rat sightings across NYC.

We will use the following data sources:

- [311 Rat Sightings Data from NYC Open
  Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe)
- [Rodent Inspect Data from NYC Open
  Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj)
- [Rat Mitigation Zones Data from NYC Environment and Health Data
  Portal](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/pests/rat-mitigation-zones/)
- [Monthly tonnage data for trash from Dept of Sanitation, NYC Open
  Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5)

Our website will explore rat sightings in NYC since 2018 across
different boroughs, location types, and zip codes. Visualizations will
also include a trend line showing the changes in rat sightings
pre-initiatives and post-initiatives over time, as well as with general
changes in population. We will analyze whether the new trash initiative
that was implemented in April is working or not and whether more
mitigation efforts need to be placed in certain geographical areas.

We foresee challenges in this project with git, reproducibility, and
collaboration. We may also face challenges in how different boroughs and
parts of the city are identified across different data sets used.
