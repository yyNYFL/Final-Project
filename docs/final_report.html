<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of
rat sightings in New York City, focusing on the periods before and after
the implementation of new trash pickup times, which shifted from after 4
pm to after 8 pm as of April 1, 2023. This change is part of Mayor Eric
Adams’ rat mitigation strategies, and our study aims to assess its
effectiveness.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this research is rooted in the significant
public health concerns associated with increased rat sightings,
especially post-COVID-19. Rats are known vectors for various diseases
and can contaminate human food sources, posing a considerable health
risk. We like many New Yorkers see rats as a major problem given the
health risks they pose. This problem has only worsened following the
pandemic. New York City government agrees and has implemented and
promoted a flashy new initiative they are calling “Send Rats Packing.”
<a
href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb2/downloads/pdf/notices/2023/SetoutTimes-Residential-Flyer-2023-02.pdf"
class="uri">https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb2/downloads/pdf/notices/2023/SetoutTimes-Residential-Flyer-2023-02.pdf</a>
This initiative is mainly composed of a new rule involving trash that
aims to reduce the time that trash, recycling, and curbside composting
will sit on the sidewalk. The new rule went into effect on April 1, 2023
and left Residential buildings and their managers with two options
-Place waste out after 6:00 PM in a container of 55 gallons or less with
a secure lid or Place waste out after 8:00 PM, if putting bags directly
on the curb. Although everyone wants to see rats gone not everyone is on
board with this new rule and many are skeptical if it is actually going
to result in less rats. The NYC Building Supers an organization composed
of building maintenance workers like porters and supers across the 5
boroughs has called this rule “outrageous and unfair” as it requires
them to work 14 hour days just to comply with the new rule. They have
banded together to strike this rule by engaging in city hall protests
and acts of civil disobedience by not complying with the new trash time.
<a href="https://nycbuildingsupers.com/"
class="uri">https://nycbuildingsupers.com/</a> Given this backdrop and
the general skepticism surrounding the effectiveness of the measure we
were motivated to explore whether or not this trash time is reduced the
presence of rats across the 5 boroughs as it has been more than half a
year since it was instated.</p>
<p>As such, this project is motivated by the need to evaluate public
policy effectiveness, particularly in urban wildlife management. By
comparing rat sighting data from different time periods and across
various NYC neighborhoods, we aim to determine whether the change in
trash disposal times has had a significant impact on the rat population.
This analysis will not only contribute to public health knowledge but
also offer insights for future urban management and rat mitigation
strategies.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the viral nature of New York City
Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch’s declaration, “The rats don’t run
this city, we do,” during the announcement of new rules for garbage
disposal back in October 2022, significantly contributes to the
motivation behind our project. This statement, which quickly became a
social media sensation and inspired a wide array of TikTok videos and
even merchandise, has heightened our interest in the issue of rat
control in New York City.</p>

<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>We were guided by some of the in-class exercises we did with the NYC
Open Data. The restaurant inspection and NYC Airbnb datasets and the
exercises we did with those data helped us throughout some of the
initial data importing and cleaning, as well as visualizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="questions-of-interest" class="section level2">
<h2>Questions of interest</h2>
<p>The main question we wanted to answer was: <strong>What effect did
the new trash time rule have on the rat sightings?</strong> Other
questions that came to mind as project brainstorming progressed were: *
How do rat sightings differ across boroughs? * How do rat sightings vary
across the time period we selected of pre, during and post pandemic
(2019-2023)? * How do rat sightings vary across geographical areas that
have different waste tonnage?</p>
<p>We could not perfectly answer some of these questions because of the
many confounders of rat sightings but we hoped to gain some insight into
what contributes to differences and reductions in rat sightings.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Data regarding rat sightings, including date, location, borough, and
more, are from <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe">NYC
Open Data’s 311 Rat Sightings</a>.</p>
<p>This dataset contains all NYC 311 Service Requests from 2010 to
present and is updated daily. It was downloaded and imported with
observations as of December 2, 2023.</p>
<p>Data regarding trash and waste are from the <a

Open Data’s Monthly tonnage data for Department of Sanitation</a>.</p>
<p>DSNY Monthly Tonnage Data provides monthly collection tonnages that

<h3>Rat Sightings: Cleaning and tidying</h3>
<p>In order to analyze <strong>the rat sightings</strong> dataset, we
used 2 data sources from NYC Open Data: 311 Rat Sightings and Monthly
tonnage data from the NYC Department of Sanitation. The 311 Rat
Sightings data was filtered to exclude observations from Staten Island
since there was significantly less data from that borough. This decision
aims to maintain consistency and reliability in our analysis by focusing
on areas with more robust data. Since the data set contained data from
more than 230,000 rat sighting reports from 2010 until present-day, we
filtered it to only include data from 2019-2023. Variable
<code>created_date</code> was separated to create three new variables to
allow for analysis: <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>,
<code>year</code>. These new variables and variables of interest to our
analysis were kept:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unique_key</code>: A unique identifier for each rat sighting
report.</li>
<li><code>location_type</code>: The type of location where the rat
sighting was reported, providing context to the environment of these
sightings.</li>
<li><code>incident_zip</code>: The ZIP code of the reported sighting,
allowing for geographical analysis.</li>
<li><code>borough</code>: The borough where the sighting occurred,
crucial for comparing sightings across different areas of the city.</li>
<li><code>location</code>: Specific coordinates of the sighting,
offering detailed geographical information in regards to latitude and
longitude.</li>
<li><code>borough_id</code>: This variable was created based on
<code>borough</code> and assigns a numeric value to each of the 4
boroughs represented in our dataset. This was done to facilitate the
dataset merging later on.</li>

<h3>Waste Tonnage: Cleaning and Tidying</h3>
<p>The <strong>monthly waste tonnage</strong> dataset was filtered to
have observations from 2022 and 2023 so that the effect of the trash
pickup timings in early 2023 is evident. In addition, a new variable
<code>total_organics</code> was created as the sum of residential
organic waste and school organic waste. The dataset was then grouped by
<code>borough</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>year</code> and
<code>borough_id</code> such that each row of the dataset had
<code>total_organics</code> and <code>total_refuse</code> for each month
and each borough in 2022 and 2023. Only variables of interest to our
analysis were kept: * * *</p>

<p>We used the <code>left_join</code> function from the
<code>dplyr</code> package to merge the rat sightings data with the
waste tonnage data. We chose to merge based on <code>borough_id</code>,
<code>month</code>, <code>year</code>, and <code>borough</code>. This
approach ensures that each rat sighting record is aligned with the
corresponding waste tonnage data based on both geographical (borough)
and temporal (month and year) factors. After merging, we applied a
filtering step to remove rows with missing values in the
<code>total_organics</code> and <code>total_refuse</code> columns.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> This bar chart shows the total amount of
trash (comprising both organics and refuse) collected in each borough of
New York City in 2022 and 2023. From the chart, it is evident that
<em>Brooklyn</em> has the highest total trash tonnage, shown by the
tallest bar. The other boroughs—Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx—are
represented with progressively smaller bars, indicating a decrease in
the total trash tonnage respectively. Staten Island is not included in
the chart, as observations from that borough were excluded. The
scientific notation on the y-axis was used for a concise representation
of large numbers, indicating the vast scale of waste collected in across
the boroughs.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> This plot shows that Brooklyn leads in
refuse production, with Queens closely following, indicative of their
larger populations and potentially more commercial activity. The Bronx
and Manhattan, while still contributing significantly, show lower
quantities of refuse. Notably, the volume of refuse is substantially
higher than organics, suggesting that non-recyclable and non-compostable
waste constitutes a larger proportion of the city’s waste output.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> This figure portrays a similar bar chart
but focuses on organic waste. The trends here are slightly different;
Queens surpasses Brooklyn in organic waste, which might reflect more
effective organic waste collection policies or higher community
engagement in composting programs. Manhattan and the Bronx have much
lower figures for organic waste, which might be due to differences in
residential patterns, availability of green spaces, or varying levels of
participation in organic waste recycling programs.</p>
<p>Comparing the two figures, it is evident that the refuse and organics
are managed differently across boroughs, with refuse being the dominant

<p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> This multi-line chart tracks the volume of
trash, both organics and refuse, collected over time across different
boroughs of New York City from early 2022 to the end of 2023. In this
visualization, Brooklyn is depicted with a prominent peak, suggesting a
significant increase in trash tonnage in summer months, potentially
indicative of seasonal variations or specific events impacting waste
production. The other boroughs also show variability, with Queens and
Manhattan following similar trajectories and the Bronx displaying the
least amount of trash tonnage overall.</p>
