## Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of rat sightings in New York City, focusing on the periods before and after the implementation of new trash pickup times, which shifted from after 4 pm to after 8 pm as of April 1, 2023. This change is part of Mayor Eric Adams' rat mitigation strategies, and our study aims to assess its effectiveness. The motivation behind this research is rooted in the significant public health concerns associated with increased rat sightings, especially post-COVID-19. Rats are known vectors for various diseases and can contaminate human food sources, posing a considerable health risk.

This project is also motivated by the need to evaluate public policy effectiveness, particularly in urban wildlife management. By comparing rat sighting data from different time periods and across various NYC neighborhoods, we aim to determine whether the change in trash disposal times has had a significant impact on the rat population. This analysis will not only contribute to public health knowledge but also offer insights for future urban management and rat mitigation strategies.

Last but certainly not least, the viral nature of New York City Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch's declaration, "The rats don't run this city, we do," during the announcement of new rules for garbage disposal back in October 2022, significantly contributes to the motivation behind our project. This statement, which quickly became a social media sensation and inspired a wide array of TikTok videos and even merchandise, has heightened our interest in the issue of rat control in New York City.
